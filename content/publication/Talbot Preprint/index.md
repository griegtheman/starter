abstract: Talbot effect is a self-imaging or lensless imaging phenomenon of a periodic grating illuminated by a collimated light beam at regular distances from the grating. Research on the Talbot effect has recently made significant strides thanks to the quick development of optical superlattices. The emergence of various applications of this effect in fields such as optics, acoustics, X-ray, plasmonics, and information processing has led to the increasing importance of obtaining a Talbot carpet with the use of different structures. In this paper, we investigate the Talbot effect that originates from the tunneling effect between an ensemble of vertically coupled cylindrical quantum dots (QDs). The Talbot carpet can be manipulated by changing the parameters of the QD system. In the current paper, two modified Pöschl-Teller potentials were used to model the QDs ensemble. The exciton’s lifetime and tunneling time’s dependence on the first QD’s potential half-width is found for a fixed value of the external electric field. The nonlinear changes in the refractive index and absorption spectrum dependent on the tunneling effect are obtained. Afterward, the Talbot carpet formation is investigated, particularly the dependences of the formed periodic wavefront’s visibility on medium length, coupling field’s strength, and tunneling parameter. Finally, we have observed the intensity distribution of the diffraction field at Talbot half-distance.
