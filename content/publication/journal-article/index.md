abstract: "Considering the increasing number of experimental results in the
  manufacturing process of quantum dots (QDs) with different geometries, and the
  fact that most numerical methods that can be used to investigate quantum dots
  with nontrivial geometries require large computational capacities, the finite
  element method (FEM) becomes an incredibly attractive tool for modeling
  semiconductor QDs. In the current article, we used FEM to obtain the first
  twenty-six probability densities and energy values for the following GaAs
  structures: rectangular, spherical, cylindrical, ellipsoidal, spheroidal, and
  conical QDs, as well as quantum rings, nanotadpoles, and nanostars. The
  results of the numerical calculations were compared with the exact analytical
  solutions and a good deviation was obtained. The ground-state energy
  dependence on the element size was obtained to find the optimal parameter for
  the investigated structures. The abovementioned calculation results were used
  to obtain valuable insight into the effects of the size quantization’s
  dependence on the shape of the QDs. Additionally, the wavefunctions and
  energies of spherical CdSe/CdS quantum dots were obtained while taking into
  account the diffusion effects on the potential depth with the use of a
  piecewise Woods–Saxon potential. The diffusion of the effective mass and the
  dielectric permittivity was obtained with the use of a normal Woods–Saxon
  potential. A structure with a quasi-type-II band alignment was obtained at the
  core size of ≈2.2 nm This result is consistent with the experimental data"
