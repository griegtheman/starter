Grigor is a Researcher at the  [Russian-Armenian University](https://rau.am/en) and [Institute of Chemical Physics after A.B. Nalbandyan](https://www.sci.am/m/orgsview.php?id=27&langid=2). He is currently pursuing his Master’s degree in the Department of General Physics and Quantum Nanostructures with a specialization in quantum and optical electronics. His master thesis has the topic of thesis research investigates the properties of semiconductor quantum dots with non-trivial geometries and quantum dots as platforms for quantum information, quantum optics, and nanoscale devices. 

He is also interested in the investigation of the control of quantum dot systems using various optical, electrostatic, and magnetic methods and quantum decoherence sources. His main responsibilities in the group include but are not limited to the theoretical study of low-dimensional semiconductor nanostructures and the analysis of experimental results.
