T﻿he Quantum Group is a center of excellence for quantum information and quantum optics.  It is comprised of researchers from the <!--StartFragment--> [Institute of Chemical Physics after A.B. Nalbandyan](https://www.sci.am/m/orgsview.php?id=27&langid=2) and [Russian-Armenian University](https://rau.am/en)<!--EndFragment-->.  The main research areas of our group semiconductor quantum dots with non-trivial geometries and quantum dots as platforms for quantum information and quantum devices. I'm also currently interested in the control of quantum dot systems using various optical, electrostatic, and magnetic methods and quantum decoherence sources.
